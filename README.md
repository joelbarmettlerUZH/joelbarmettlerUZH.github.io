## DeadlyBooring DOS
Denial of Service attacks do not always have to flood the server with requests to make him shut down. Deadly Booring DOS takes a much more elegant appraoch: Instead sending as much data as possible, we send as little data as we can. DeadlyBooring is a free interpretation of SlowLoris DOS.

## PyPi Guide
The PyPi package index is one of the properties that makes python so powerfull: With just a simple command, you get access to thousands of cool libraries, ready for you to use. In this short introduction, I am going to explain how you can upload upload your own code to PyPi and let others profit from your inventions.

## Simple Image Classifier

This little image classifier is a showcase of how easy it is to create a functional image classifier using just basic python and some easy to use and well-documented librariees. I prepared this script for my Informatics I - Python Programmig tutorial session in November to show my students what some basic python programming can achieve!

## Showcase - Functional vs OO-Programming
On the following pages, I want to present you a quick side-by-side comparison between developing a mini-game in a functional vs. in a object-oriented way. We are going to implement a very easy command line game, first only using functions and datastructures like older, non-object oriented programming languages like C would propably implement it. Then, we are going to implement the same functionalities, but following an object oriented approach. You will develop a good unterstanding of how Object-Orientation provides more flexibility and cleaner architecture.

## AudioRec
AudioRec is the most simple audio recorder for python. Record any sound from your standard recording device to WAV or MP3. Simply hit start, stop and save - done.
